- Open the YouTube video and follow along:
> - **[YouTube Python Decisions Practice](https://youtu.be/CT8V98x9brE)**.  
- Be sure to copy/paste your practice from the console to the **`consoleoutput.txt`** file

- When you are done with your code, your final commit message should say "Ready to grade"
